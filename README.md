⚡ Energy Consumption Analysis Dashboard for Smart Cities
📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze energy consumption trends and costs across major Indian cities. The analysis helps identify high-consumption regions, understand monthly demand patterns, and support smart city energy management strategies.

🎯 Objectives

Track total energy consumption and cost across cities.

Identify the Top 5 energy-consuming cities dynamically.

Monitor monthly consumption trends (2016–2019).

Provide actionable insights for smart city energy planning.

📊 Dashboard Features

KPIs:

🔹 Total Consumption: 210M units

🔹 Total Cost: 15.84M

Filters/Slicers:

Energy Type

City (multiple selections)

Date range (2016–2019)

Visuals:

Bar Chart (Top 5 Cities): Highlights the top consumers dynamically based on slicer selection.

Line Chart: Shows monthly energy usage trends for all cities.

🔑 Key Insights

Top 5 Cities (by Consumption):

Jaipur, New Delhi, Indore, Bhopal, and Chennai are the highest energy consumers (≈19M–20M units each).

Monthly Trends (2016–2019):

Strong seasonal fluctuations observed, ranging between 0.2M – 0.6M units/month.

Peaks often occur during summer and monsoon months.

City Performance:

Jaipur & New Delhi consistently show the highest energy usage.

Cities like Kerala and Visakhapatnam exhibit more stable patterns compared to metros.

Overall Outlook:

High consumption cities may require better energy demand-side management.

Monthly monitoring helps in peak load forecasting and resource optimization.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Power BI – Dashboard creation & visualization

Excel – Dataset preparation & cleaning

🚀 How to Use

Open the Power BI file Internship project.pbix.

Use slicers to filter by city, energy type, and date range.

Explore Top 5 consumption cities and analyze monthly demand patterns.

📂 Resources

📑 Dataset: Energy Consumptions Dataset.xlsx

📊 Dashboard: Internship project.pbix

📝 Conclusion

The dashboard serves as a decision-support tool for policymakers and planners, enabling them to:

Identify top energy-consuming regions.

Analyze seasonal demand patterns.

Develop strategies for energy optimization in smart cities.

✅ Would you like me to embed your dashboard screenshots directly inside the README (so they appear on GitHub), or keep it clean text-only?

You said:
Can i remove dataset and only have dashboard
ChatGPT said:

Yes 👍 you can absolutely remove the dataset and keep only the dashboard file (Internship project.pbix) in your GitHub repo.

Here’s why and how:

✅ Why you can skip dataset

If the dataset is large, private, or sensitive, it’s better not to upload it.

The dashboard itself is enough to showcase your skills (data modeling, DAX, visualization).

Recruiters or reviewers usually care about your dashboard design & insights, not the raw file.

🛠️ What to keep in your repo

Internship project.pbix (Power BI dashboard file)

README.md (project explanation, screenshots, insights)

📸 Dashboard screenshots (to display visuals in README)

🔄 README Adjustment

Instead of Resources → Dataset, just mention:

## 📂 Resources  
- 📊 Dashboard: `Internship project.pbix`  
- 📸 Screenshots: Included in this README  


👉 This way, your repo is clean and still professional.

Would you like me to now finalize the README with dataset removed and screenshots embedded so it’s GitHub-ready?

You said:
Put my pbix file in dashboard 
ChatGPT said:

Got it ✅ You want your .pbix file to be highlighted as the main part of your project instead of the dataset.
Here’s the final README.md (clean + professional + dataset removed):
