⚡ Energy Consumption Analysis Dashboard for Smart Cities
📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze energy consumption trends and costs across major Indian cities.
The dashboard highlights Top 5 high-consumption cities, provides monthly trend analysis, and supports smart city energy planning.

🎯 Objectives

🔹Track total energy consumption and cost across cities.

🔹Identify the Top 5 energy-consuming cities dynamically.

🔹Monitor monthly consumption trends (2016–2019).

🔹Provide actionable insights for energy management.

📊 Dashboard Features

KPIs:

🔹 Total Consumption: 210M units

🔹 Total Cost: 15.84M

Filters/Slicers:

🔹Energy Type

🔹City (multi-select)

🔹Date Range (2016–2019)

Visuals:
